<h1>Projeto Ap!ta</h1>
<p>Projeto Ap!ta was my final project for my technical degree in software development.</p>
<p>It is a fictional sportive news website, made using pure PHP for its back-end and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some frameworks for the website front-end.</p>
<h2><b>Important Notes</b></h2>
<ul>
  <li>You need to run the BD file in PHPmyAdmin or MySQL workbench</li>
  <li>After doing that, for the website to work, you need to first create an account in it after creating the DB and, in PHPmyAdmin, change the account type to "2", so it's an admin</li>
  <li>Create at least 3 "not√≠cias" and 3 "interviews" with the admin account so the website front-end works properly</li>
  <li>Be sure to explore every functionality!</li>
</ul>
